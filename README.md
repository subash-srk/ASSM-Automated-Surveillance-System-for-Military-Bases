# Automated Surveillance System for Military Bases

## Description
This project proposes a software solution with face recognition and weapon detection to improve perimeter security. Using face recognition algorithms, the system seeks to identify possible invaders into the military bases while concurrently identifying and categorizing any weapons they could be carrying. The technology is designed to detect threats and promptly notify those in authority in order to enable prompt and decisive responses. By integrating seamlessly with existing surveillance infrastructure, this software offers a proactive approach to safeguarding military installations, ultimately enhancing overall security and operational readiness.
