# Automated Surveillance System for Military Bases

## Description
<p>Modern military bases need the most sophisticated safety measures possible. This project proposes a software solution that makes use of cutting-edge technology like face recognition and weapon detection to improve perimeter security. Using face recognition algorithms, the system seeks to identify possible invaders while concurrently identifying and categorizing any weapons they could be carrying. The technology is designed to detect threats and promptly notify those in authority in order to enable prompt and decisive responses.</p>
